This project is an evaluation project to compare/contrast various Go http
frameworks. The *planned* targets include (in no particular order):

- ServeMux
- [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
- [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo)
- [HttpRouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)

We'll see how far I get. :)

I needed an API to work with so I decided to play around with the weather API from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org). It's easy enough to sign up for a free account.
