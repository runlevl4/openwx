This project is an evaluation project to compare/contrast various Go http
frameworks. The *planned* targets include:

- ServeMux
- Gorilla Mux
- Chi
- Gin
- Echo

We'll see how far I get. :)

I needed an API to work with so I decided to play around with the weather API from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org). It's easy enough to sign up for a free account.
